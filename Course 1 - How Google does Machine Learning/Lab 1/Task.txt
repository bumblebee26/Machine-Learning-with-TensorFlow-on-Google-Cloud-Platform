Human Bias
1. Interaction Bias - Covering all types of shoes
2. Latent Bias - Past physicist list was skewed with high number of men
3. Selection Bias - Collecting face images of everyone


Confusion Matrix
•	False positive rate (α) = type I error = 1 − specificity = FP / (FP + TN)
•	False negative rate (β) = type II error = 1 − sensitivity = FN / (TP + FN)
•	True positive rate (TPR), Recall, Sensitivity, probability of detection = Σ True positive/Σ Condition positive
•	Accuracy (ACC) = Σ True positive + Σ True negative/Σ Total population
•	Precision = Σ True positive/Σ Predicted condition positive


Data Visualization using Facets


Week 1 – Task 1
•	Create a Compute Engine instance with specific security permissions.
•	SSH into the instance.
•	Install the software package Git (for source code version control).
•	Ingest data into the Compute Engine instance.
•	Transform data on the Compute Engine instance.
•	Store the transformed data on Cloud Storage.
•	Publish Cloud Storage data to the web.
